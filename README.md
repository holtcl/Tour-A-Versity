### Introduction
Going to a new University can be an intimidating experience. Wondering on to campus for the first time can seem extremely overwhelming to someone who isnâ€™t prepared. That is where Tour-A-Versity comes in. This app is designed to give students and visitors a guide around campus to help them find there way to where they want to go, and maybe learn a few fun facts on the way.
